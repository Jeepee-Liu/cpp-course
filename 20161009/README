This project is to simulate a 1D Monte-Carlo walk.

/* main program */

	Run 'make' to compile the C++ program into an
	executable file (named as 'example' by default).

	The output file is write into './tmp.log'.

/* data parsing and visualizing */

	Run './parseData.py' to parse the output data from
	the simulation C++ program.

	Both image output and statistical output are
	avaliable.

/* Scripted Multi-point simulation and  */
	
	Run exec.py by executing './exec.py' to simulate
	different parameters. Setting of exec.py is in the
	function 'setup()'.

	Output is in graphic form and a '*.png' file would be saved in the root directory.
