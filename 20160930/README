## INTRODUCTION

This program is to simulate 2-dimensional random walk.
A point determined by its (x, y) coordinate is moving on
a xy-plane step by step complied with the recursive rule
below:
	
	x(i+1) = x(i) + dx(l,p);
	y(i+1) = y(i) + dy(l,p);

Where x(i) and y(i) denote the x and y coordinate of the
point after i steps; dx(l,p) and dy(l,p) denote two
independent random variable uniformly distributed in
[-l,l], with probability p to move a full step and (1-p)
to move half a step.

## PARAMETERS

To see more about parameter settings, run the program
with "-h".

## OUTCOME

By default, the outcome would be written in the file
"./tmplog.txt" as text file.

## COMPILATION

"g++ compiler is required to compile the file. To
recompile, use command "make" in the root directory.
The executable file is named as "example" by default. 

It is strongly recommended to recompile the program
before you run it. 

## DATA VISUALIZATION

A python2 script "parseData.py" is provided in the root
directory to visualize the data.
Just run "python parseData.py" if you did not changed the output file name.
